<p>  Details of Sherlock Holmes’s life in Conan Doyle’s stories are scarce and often vague. Nevertheless, mentions of his early life and extended family paint a loose biographical picture of the detective</p>
<br>
<p>Holmes says that he first developed his methods of deduction as an undergraduate; his earliest cases, which he pursed as an amateur, came from fellow university students. A meeting with a classmate’s father led him to adopt detections a profession.  </p>

<p> It was worth a wound; it was worth many wounds; to know the depth of loyalty and love which lay behind that cold mask. The clear, hard eyes were dimmed for a moment, and the firm lips were shaking. For the one and only time I caught a glimpse of a great heart as well as of a great brain. All my years of humble but single -minded service culminated in thar moment of revelation. </p>

<p> It is simplicity itself… my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey.</p>

<p> Though Holmes is famed  for his reasoning capabilities, his investigative technique heavily relies   heavily on the acquisition of hard evidence. Many of the techniques he employs in the stories were at the time in their infancy.</p>
<br>
<p>Had been drinking his beer in the tap-room, and had heard the whole conversation, who was I? what  Did I want? What did I mean by asking questions? He had a fine flow of language, and his adjectivies were very vigorous. He ended a string of abuse by a vicious backhander, which I failed to entirely avoid, The next few minutes were delicious. It was a straight left against a slogging ruffian. I emergeras you see me. Mr Woosley went home in a cart.</p>

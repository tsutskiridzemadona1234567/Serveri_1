<h3>about </h3>
<p> Ego has no place in the design process. Fail quickly to succeed quickly. <br> Negative feedback is a gift. Universal design is ethical design. <br> Designers are toolmakers. <br> Meet people where they are. Be a facilitator. <br> Define the problem. Play. Thereâ€™s always more than one solution. <br> Emopathy is the key to resonance. You are not your user. </p>

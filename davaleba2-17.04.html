<p> <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy <u>text</u> of the printing and typesetting industry. </p>
<p><b><i> Lorem Ipsum</b></i> has been the industryâ€™s standard dummy text ever since <mark>1500s, </mark>when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. </p>
<p> It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <mark>1960s</mark> with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum oassages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <b><s>Aldus PageMaker</b></s> including versions of Lorem Ipsum. </p>
